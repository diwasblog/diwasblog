<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">When you as developer build your application and from your perspective, you check the project and is working while and then now you will give the project(via zip or anything) to tester then tester will load the project and tester will find that project is not working in their environment because there may be dependency issue. Suppose you are using windows 10 and tester is using windows xp then there may be a dependency issue. Suppose say you have .net framework 4.5 installed in your machine and tester just has .net framework 4.0 then there may occur problem in a testing environment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #2dc26b;">The solution is VMWare or Hypervisor&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">In VMWare or Virtual Machine or Hypervisor, you can install OS, software, and application.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">To solve this problem developers create an image of working OS (containing working project along with dependencies) and then gives the entire image of OS then the tester will load the image then test it. Here, tester has not to worry anything because the developer has given everything. Then tester creates test code and everything works well then they again create an image of OS and give it to operation team. Then the operation team checks it and if all OK then they install the image of OS with software in the production server.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Suppose say you have <span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>10 application </strong></span>then may have <span style="color: #2dc26b;">10 different types of image of OS</span> then these<strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;"> 10 virtual OS is installed on the main server (say Linux OS)</span></strong>. But the problem with virtual OS is :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #e03e2d;">They take hardware space (HDD, RAM, Processor)&nbsp;</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Again to reduce resource usage: Docker came into the picture</span></strong></span></p>
