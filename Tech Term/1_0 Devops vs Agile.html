            agile we need specialist team for Frontend, and specialist team for backend, but we are not using that

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Many big companies like amazon, netflix, target ,walmart uses devops techniques and
    finds considerable improvement in delivery and quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What operation and Development Team in Devops
        ?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Suppose I have developed the robot for training it and for operation of that robot I
    kept that robot to operation teams called RoboOperation.But while When robot is set in operational environment then
    robot started to malfunction so for that operation team and development (me) team should colaboration with each
    other and solve the problem.And this collaboration between Development and Operations team makes devops practice in
    use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But in agile practice , development and operation team donot collaboration with each
    other.</span></p>
