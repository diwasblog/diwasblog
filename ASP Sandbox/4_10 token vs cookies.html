<td style="width: 50%; height: 158px;">Cookie-based authentication is&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>stateful</strong></span>. This means that an authentication record or<span style="color: #000000;"><strong> session must be kept both server and client-side</strong></span>. The server needs to keep track of active sessions in a database, while on the front-end a cookie is created that holds a session identifier, thus the name cookie based authentication.</td>
<td style="width: 50%; height: 158px;">Token-based authentication is&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>stateless</strong></span>. The<strong><span style="color: #000000;"> server does not keep a record of which users are logged in</span> </strong>or which JWTs have been issued. Instead, every request to the server is accompanied by a token which the server uses to verify the authenticity of the request. The token is generally sent as an addition Authorization header in the&nbsp;form of&nbsp;<code>Bearer {JWT}</code>, but can additionally be sent in the body of a POST request or even as a query parameter</td>

<td style="width: 50%; height: 103px;">A session cookie is<span style="color: #000000;"><strong> relatively tiny</strong></span> compared to even the smallest JWT.</td>
<td style="width: 50%; height: 103px;">&nbsp;Biggest disadvantage of token authentication is the size of JWTs. Depending on your use case,<strong><span style="color: #000000;"> the size of the token could become problematic if you add many claims to it</span></strong>. Remember, each request to the server must include the JWT along with it.</td>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Where to Store Tokens?</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With token-based auth, you are given the choice of where to store the JWT. Commonly, the JWT is placed in the browser's local storage and this works well for most use cases. There are some issues with storing JWTs in local storage to be aware of. Unlike cookies, local storage is sandboxed to a<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> specific domain and its data cannot be accessed by any other domain including sub-domains</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You can store the token in a cookie instead, but <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>the max size of a cookie is only 4kb so that may be problematic if you have many claims attached to the token.</strong></span> Additionally, you can store the token in session storage which is similar to local storage but <strong><span style="color: #000000;">is cleared as soon as the user closes the browser.</span></strong></span></p>
